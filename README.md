# Deep Learning based Pipeline with Multichannel Inputs for Patent ClassificationÂ¶

Patent document classification as groundwork has been a challenging task with no satisfactory performance for decades.  In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline for automatic patent classification with multichannel inputs.   A neural network model is trained with multichannel inputs namely embeddings of different segments of patent texts, and sparse linear input of different metadata.
