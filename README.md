# Deep Learning based Pipeline with Multichannel Inputs for Patent ClassificationÂ¶

Patent document classification as groundwork has been a challenging task with no satisfactory performance for decades.  In this work, we introduce a deep learning pipeline for automatic patent classification with multichannel inputs.   A neural network model is trained with multichannel inputs namely embeddings of different segments of patent texts, and sparse linear input of different metadata.

Currently the repository contains three examples:

1. Multi-class Patent Classification with multichannel inputs (https://github.com/sofean-mso/DeepL4Patent/blob/master/Deep4Patent%20Pipeline%20for%20Multi-class%20Patent%20Classification.ipynb): The Main IPC code is used as a label for the patent document

2. Multi-label Patent Classification with multichannel inputs: The full IPC codes are used as a label for the patent document

3. Multi-class Patent Classification with a single channel input
